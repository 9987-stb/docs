### Live Disk or Pop Recovery 



### Disks application

The <u>Disks</u> application can be used to format the drive to remove any personal data and it comes pre-installed on Pop!_OS and Ubuntu.

In this screenshot the drive is a USB Flash Drive though the concept is the same for any drive including where your OS is installed. First left-click on the drive on the left side then left-click on the top right menu with three dots (three lines on older releases).

Now select the **Format Disk...** option then make sure to have the 'Compatible with modern systems and hard drives > 2TB (GPT)' selected (you can use either the Quick option or the Slow option).
