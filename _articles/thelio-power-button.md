If you've purchased a new top case for your Thelio (or received one for a support case), you may need to move the power button from your old top case to the new one. Conversely, if you've received a replacement power button, you may need to remove the old one from your top case and install the new one.

# Removing the Power Button

The power button is held on from the inside by a nut around the button. First, loosen the nut using a pair of needle-nose pliers.

Once the nut has been loosened, you can unscrew it the rest of the way using your fingers.

Without the nut to secure it, the button will slide out the front of the case.

The button will still be connected to the 90-degree connector inside of the machine. You'll need to unplug the button from this connector.

Once unplugged, the button can be completely removed. (The plastic rectangle inside of the case will be loose at this point, and can also be removed.)

# Installing the power button

To put the new button in, line up the black rectangle with the hole on the inside of the case, then insert the power button in from the outside.

Make sure to thread the power button's wire through the center of the nut. Screw the nut onto the button to hold the assembly together (once again, a needle-nose pliers can be used once . Plug the power button's wire into the 90-degree connector so the red wire is on the left.
