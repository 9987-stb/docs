### Accessing Repoman

Pop!_OS' tool for adding, removing and editing repositiories is called <u>Repoman</u> which is a part of the Pop!_Shop.

Once <u>Repoman</u> is opened, click on the **Extra Sources** button from this tab there will be options to add repositories with the **Plus** button (on the bottom left) to add repositories. Select a repository from the list and then click on the **Edit** button (next to the **Plus** button) to edit the existing repository.
