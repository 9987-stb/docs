The [Augmented Reality Sandbox](https://arsandbox.ucdavis.edu/) was developed by [Oliver Kreylos](http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).

In hopes of giving this awesome software wider exposure and making it easier to consume, System76 [packaged this software for Ubuntu-based OSes](https://launchpad.net/~system76-dev/+archive/ubuntu/weekend-project) and wrote this tutorial.

### Required Hardware

This tutorial focuses on installing and calibrating the software, but wont cover the details of the hardware setup.

For detailed information on the hardware setup, see the [AR Sandbox hardware tutorial](https://arsandbox.ucdavis.edu/instructions/hardware-2/), but in brief you'll need:

- A first generation Kinect

- A short-throw digital projector like the [BenQ MW632ST](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010MDRIEA)

- A sandbox for your sand (our sandbox is 40 inches by 30 inches by 8 inches)

- Roughly 200 pounds of white sand like [Sandtastik White Sandbox Sand](https://www.amazon.com/Sandtastik-White-Play-Sand-SND025/dp/B001AZ0CGG)

- A Linux-friendly computer with a fast NVIDIA GPU, running Pop!_OS/Ubuntu 18.04 or newer (any flavor).

In terms of System76 computers we recommend the [Oryx Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx) laptop or [Thelio](https://system76.com/cart/configure/thelio-r1) desktop with the fastest available GPU.
