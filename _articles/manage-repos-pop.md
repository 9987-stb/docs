Click on the gear icon in the top right of the <u>Pop!_Shop</u> window. Once <u>Repoman</u> is opened, click on the **Extra Sources** tab there will be options to add repositories with the **Plus** button (on the bottom left). Select a repository from the list and then click on the **Edit** button (next to the **Plus** button) to edit the selected repository.
